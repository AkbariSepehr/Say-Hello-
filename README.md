# Say-Hello 

I've created this super super super simple GUI aaplication using Java with NetBeans.

It inputs the users name and says hallo to them :)

This is how it works.


As always, try to download the code and "Make it better"

for that you need these installed:

- java 
- JDK 
- Swing library 
- and NetBeans IDE
